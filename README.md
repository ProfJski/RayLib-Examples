# RayLib-Examples
Some fun math or physics demos made easy with RayLib

<b>Strange Attractor:</b>
Plots the Clifford Pickover attractor, a point cloud in 3D space
Top sliders demonstrate the fact that the system is an attractor: initial conditions don't change the shape
Bottom sliders vary the parameters of the system, giving rise to a wide variety of attractor shapes
Check boxes allow you to cycle through two parameters gradually to see the changes

<b>Lorenz Attractor:</b>
Plots the Lorenz attractor using lines in 3D space
